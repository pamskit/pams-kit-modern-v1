# UI Kit – HTML & CSS Only

This project is a **static UI Kit built with pure HTML and CSS**.
No JavaScript, build tools, or server setup is required.

## 📂 Component Access

Each UI component lives in its own folder and can be accessed by opening its HTML file directly.

### How to Open a Component

```
/components/{component-name}/component-name.html
```

### Examples

- Button
  ```
  components/button/button.html
  ```
- Card
  ```
  components/card/card.html
  ```

Simply **double-click the HTML file** or open it in any modern browser.

## ℹ️ Notes

- Do not change the folder structure to avoid broken CSS paths.
- All components are **standalone** and rely only on shared global styles inside the `base/` folder.
- This UI Kit is intended for design preview, layout reference, and frontend styling.
